# wiki-research

Fill knowledge gaps from web sources and save results back to wiki. This skill is
**fully self-contained** — follow these instructions to execute the complete workflow.

## Overview

```
Topic → [wiki-research] → wiki/queries/research-<topic>-<date>.md
              ↓
       - Web search
       - Synthesize results
       - Save to wiki
       - Auto-ingest (optional)
```

**Pipeline position:** Can be triggered by gaps in wiki-query, or directly by user.

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Search Queries

#### 1a. Extract Key Terms

From research topic:
- Main subject
- Technical terms
- Domain keywords

#### 1b. Generate Query Variations

Create 3-5 search queries:

| Variation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Direct topic | "attention mechanism" |
| "What is" form | "what is attention mechanism" |
| Acronym (if applicable) | "NLP attention" |
| Technical form | "attention mechanism neural network" |
| Comparison (if applicable) | "attention vs self-attention" |

---

### Step 2: Execute Web Search

#### 2a. Call Search API

Use available web search tool:

```
mcp__web-search or similar

Parameters:
- query: <search query>
- max_results: 5 per query
```

#### 2b. Collect Results

For each query:
- Execute search
- Collect results (title, URL, snippet, source)
- Track which query found each result

#### 2c. Deduplicate

Remove duplicate URLs:
- Normalize URLs (lowercase, remove trailing slash)
- Keep first occurrence
- Merge query sources

---

### Step 3: Read Wiki Context

#### 3a. Read Wiki Index

Read `wiki/index.md` to understand existing pages.

#### 3b. Identify Cross-References

Find existing wiki pages that should be referenced in the research:
- Entities mentioned in research topic
- Concepts related to topic
- Procedures that might apply

**Why:** Research should link to existing wiki content with `[[wikilinks]]`.

---

### Step 4: Synthesize Results

#### 4a. Build Synthesis Prompt

```
You are a research assistant synthesizing web search results into a wiki page.

Topic: <research topic>

Web Results:
[1] Title: <title>
Source: <source>
<snippet>

[2] Title: <title>
Source: <source>
<snippet>
...

Existing Wiki Pages (link to these with [[wikilink]]):
- [[existing-page-1]]
- [[existing-page-2]]
...

Create a comprehensive wiki page that:
1. Synthesizes information from all sources
2. Uses [N] citations for web sources
3. Uses [[wikilink]] for existing wiki concepts
4. Notes contradictions or gaps
5. Suggests additional sources
6. Is written in neutral, encyclopedic tone
7. Matches the language of the topic (Chinese/English)
```

#### 4b. Generate Synthesis

Use LLM to generate comprehensive synthesis.

---

### Step 4.5: ⚠️ Research Direction Checkpoint (IMPORTANT)

**Before finalizing research, confirm with user:**

When research scope is large or findings are unexpected, pause and ask:

```
Research Preview for: <topic>

Key findings so far:
- <finding 1>
- <finding 2>
- <finding 3>

Sources: N results from web search

Continue with full synthesis? Or adjust focus?
```

**Why this checkpoint matters:**
- Prevents wasting time on wrong research direction
- Allows user to narrow or expand scope based on preview
- Ensures research aligns with user's actual need

**Skip checkpoint only when:**
- Single focused query (auto-proceed)
- User explicitly requested "research and save"
- Research is filling a specific gap from wiki-query

---

### Step 5: Build Research Page

#### 5a. Generate Frontmatter

```yaml
---
type: query
title: "Research: <topic>"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
origin: deep-research
tags: [research, <domain>]
---
```

#### 5b. Format Content

```markdown
---
type: query
title: "Research: <topic>"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
origin: deep-research
tags: [research, <domain>]
---

# Research: <topic>

<synthesized content with [N] citations>

## Key Findings

- <finding 1> [1]
- <finding 2> [2]

## Gaps Remaining

- <information not found>

## References

1. [<title 1>](<url>) — <source>
2. [<title 2>](<url>) — <source>
```

#### 5c. Clean Thinking Blocks

Remove any `<think>` or `<thinking>` blocks from LLM output.

---

### Step 6: Save to Wiki

#### 6a. Generate Filename

```
wiki/queries/research-<slug>-<date>.md
```

**Slug:** Topic lowercase, spaces→hyphens, remove special chars, limit 50 chars.

#### 6b. Write File

Create file at determined path.

---

### Step 7: Auto-Ingest (Optional)

Trigger `wiki-compile` on the research result:
- Extract entities and concepts
- Generate cross-references
- Update wiki graph

**Note:** This is optional but recommended for full integration.

---

### Step 8: Report Results

```markdown
# Research Complete

**Topic:** <topic>
**Saved to:** wiki/queries/research-<topic>-<date>.md

## Summary

<brief summary of findings>

## Sources Used

- [<title 1>](<url>)
- [<title 2>](<url>)

## Cross-References Created

- [[existing-wiki-page-1]]
- [[existing-wiki-page-2]]

## Next Steps

- Run `/wiki-compile` to extract entities and concepts
- Or review and edit the research page manually
```

---

## Tools to Use

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Web search API | Search the web |
| `readFile` | Read wiki index |
| `writeFile` | Save research page |
| `listDirectory` | Refresh file tree |
| LLM API | Synthesize results |

---

## Search Query Generation Heuristics

```python
def generate_search_queries(topic):
    queries = [topic]
    
    # Add "what is" variation
    if not topic.lower().startswith("what is"):
        queries.append(f"what is {topic}")
    
    # Add acronym if detected
    words = topic.split()
    acronym = "".join(w[0].upper() for w in words if w[0].isupper())
    if 2 <= len(acronym) <= 5:
        queries.append(acronym)
    
    # Add technical context
    if any(tech in topic.lower() for tech in ["model", "network", "algorithm"]):
        queries.append(f"{topic} machine learning")
    
    return queries[:5]
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Technical Research

**Topic:** "Transformer architecture"

**Process:**
1. Queries: ["Transformer architecture", "what is Transformer", "Transformer neural network"]
2. Web search: Collect 10-15 results
3. Read wiki index: Found [[attention-mechanism]], [[neural-network]]
4. Synthesize with cross-references
5. Save: `wiki/queries/research-transformer-architecture-2026-05-12.md`

**Output:**
```markdown
---
type: query
title: "Research: Transformer Architecture"
created: 2026-05-12
origin: deep-research
tags: [research, deep-learning, nlp]
---

# Research: Transformer Architecture

The Transformer is a neural network architecture introduced in "Attention Is All You Need" [1]. Unlike recurrent architectures, Transformers use self-attention to process sequences in parallel.

## Key Components

- **Self-Attention**: Computes relationships between all positions simultaneously. See [[attention-mechanism]].
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds position information to embeddings.
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Applied to each position independently.

## Key Findings

- Transformers enable parallel processing of sequences [1]
- Self-attention scales as O(n²) in sequence length [2]
- Foundation for models like BERT and GPT [3]

```

### Example 2: Gap-Filling Research

**Trigger:** wiki-query returned "No information found on attention mechanisms"

**Process:**
1. Topic: "attention mechanism in deep learning"
2. Search and synthesize
3. Save research
4. Auto-ingest to create [[attention-mechanism]] concept page

---

## Quality Principles

1. **Cite all sources** — Use [N] notation consistently
2. **Cross-reference wiki** — Link to existing concepts
3. **Acknowledge gaps** — Note what wasn't found
4. **Neutral tone** — Encyclopedic, not promotional
5. **Prefer authoritative sources** — Papers, docs over blogs

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| No web results | Report "No results found", suggest refining topic |
| Search API fails | Report error, suggest manual search |
| Cannot save file | Report error, provide content for manual save |
| LLM synthesis fails | Return raw search results |
